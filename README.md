# HW6

You can upload the response to question 1 as its own .MD file.

## Question 1 (10 points)
Following along with Schimel's Writing Science, continue constructing your paper. For now, include the code inline in this document and create and upload a .MD

##### Introduction
Describe the larger problem you are contributing to. What direction is your project taking? Why is your work important?
This should state the research question that you are answering.

##### Data
This should summarize the structure of the dataset. Include exploratory graphics in this section.

##### Methods
Write out the model that you are proposing for this data. This should include mathematical notation and the assumptions in the specified model.

##### Analysis
Analyze your data (or simulated response from HW5).

## Question 2 (15 points)

Using your software of choice, fit a spatial regression model to explain the housing price in the Seattle housing dataset [http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/SeattleHousing.csv](http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/SeattleHousing.csv).

Treat this like a report to a collaborator. It should include the following parts: introduction, data, methods, analysis, and results. Additionally, make sure to include some discussion of the effect of the covariates on the response and a spatial prediction map.
